The Mojo is a FPGA development board that is designed from the ground up to be easy to use.

The Mojo FPGA Development Board

The Mojo features include

Spartan 6 XC6SLX9 FPGA
84 digital IO pins
8 analog inputs
8 general purpose LEDs
1 reset button
1 LED to show when the FPGA is correctly configured 
On board voltage regulation that can handle 4.8V - 12V
A microcontroller (ATmega16U4) used for configuring the FPGA, USB communications, and reading the analog pins
On board flash memory to store the FPGA configuration file
The microcontroller comes with a USB (DFU) bootloader which will allow you to install future upgrades to the firmware without having to buy a programmer. Once the board is powered on the microcontroller configures the FPGA from the flash memory. After the FPGA is succesfully configured the microcontroller enters slave mode. This allows your FPGA designs to talk to the microcontroller; giving you access to the serial port and the analog inputs.
